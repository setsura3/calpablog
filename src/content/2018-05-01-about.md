## About Chen

Welcome to my technical blog, I am Xin (Chris) Chen, a veteran, soldier, and a developer with enthusiasm at app security and cloud computing, etc. 



The blog I am using is powered by  GatsbyJS and ReactJS; I deployed it on AWS(Amplify) for practice purposes. 

Feel free to contact me if you need help with deploying a website on AWS. My email isï¼š[xchen190325@gmail.com](mailto:xchen190325@gmail.com)

## Why blog

Technical blogging is proved to be one of the best practices in the industry. I believe blogging will make me a better developer, writer, and learner.

## Timeline

### 2016 to 2/2020

Served the U.S. Army as a combat medic, started self-teaching while deploying at Irap(It was 2018, We had a lot of downtimes, I decided to become a developer since then.)
